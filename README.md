# tree-branch-detection
This project uses Python and OpenCV to detect the orientation and position of small tree branches from a photo. It's part of an automation solution designed to assist with pruning tasks in real-world, outdoor conditions.

🔍 What It Does
Takes an image of a tree or bush as input

Converts the image into a binary mask to isolate features

Detects branch-like structures and highlights them with red dots

Calculates and displays the centroid of the detected branches

🖼️ Example
Here’s the image used for testing:
![bush_pic1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/813d4b9e-516c-45e9-8cfb-bad077bbf089)

⚙️ Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

NumPy

📁 How to Use
Clone the repository

Run the Python script

Provide your own image or use the included test image

View the output with highlighted branches and centroid location

✨ Why This Matters
This was developed during an internship with a startup robotics company in Colombia. It helped me apply image processing techniques in unpredictable real-world conditions — far from the ideal setups we often see in university labs.
